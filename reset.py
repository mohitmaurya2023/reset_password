# Here's an example of how you can create a reset password feature in Streamlit by sending an email with a reset link:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import email
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

# Create a form to input email address
email_address = st.text_input('Enter your email address')

# Create a function to send reset password email
def send_reset_password_email(email_address):
    # Create a password reset link
    reset_link = 'http://localhost:8501/reset_password'
    
    # Create an email message
    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg.set_content(f'Reset your password: {reset_link}')
    msg['Subject'] = 'Reset Password'
    msg['From'] = 'mohitkmourya@gmail.com'
    msg['To'] = email_address
    
    # Send the email using smtplib
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as smtp:
        smtp.login('mohitkmourya@gmail.com', 'gavo mgvo eqyf joke')
        smtp.send_message(msg)

# Create a button to send the reset password email
if st.button('Send Reset Password Email'):
    send_reset_password_email(email_address)
    st.success('Reset password email sent successfully!')
    st.balloons()

# This code creates a form to input an email address, a function to send a reset password email with a link, and a button to trigger the email sending process. When the button is clicked, the send_reset_password_email function is called with the input email address, which sends an email with a reset link to the user.

# Note that you'll need to replace 'your_email_address' and 'your_email_password' with your actual email address and password. Also, make sure to configure your email settings to allow less secure apps to access your account.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
